                Established in 1893, Algonquin Park is the oldest park in all of Canada, but with age only comes more
                matured beauty. The world renowned park is made up of 7,653 square kilometers of incredible diverse and
                dense forests, impressive cliffs and rolling hills, and 2,400 stunning lakes and rivers. As a National
                Historic Site of Canada, Algonquin Park boasts many extraordinary outdoor recreation activities,
                everything
                from hiking, mountain biking, camping and wildlife viewing, on the hundreds of kilometers of trails, to
                canoeing, fishing and whitewater rawfting the exciting waterways. Any adventure you’re seeking, the
                beautiful Algonquin Park is the perfect place to find it!
            </blockquote>
            <h3> Park formation</h3>
            <blockquote>An Act to establish "Algonquin National Park of Ontario" was passed by the Liberal government
                of Oliver
                Mowat in the Ontario Legislature, May 23, 1893 (56 Vic., c.8). Although called a "national park",
                Algonquin
                has always been under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. No provincial parks existed until
                Algonquin, but there was a new movement to create national parks since Banff's establishment in 1885.
                The
                name was changed to Algonquin Provincial Park in 1913.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Algonquin Logging Museum</h3>
            <blockquote>Opened in 1992, the Algonquin Logging Museum is located by the park's east gate. A 1.3
                kilometres (0.81
                mi) trail features a recreated logging camp, a steam-powered amphibious tug called an "alligator",
                logging
                equipment and interpretive panels about logging industry activities in the park. Exhibits include a
                video
                presentation. The museum is open seasonally.
                One annual feature worthy of note at the museum is "Logger's Day", typically held in late July or early
                August each year. This festivity includes musicians, a logger's old style lunch, activities for
                children, interpretive actors, and forest industry representatives.

            <h3>Fishing</h3>
            <blockquote>Fishing is allowed in the park for holders of valid Ontario fishing licences, with the purchase
                of a
                daily
                or seasonal vehicle permit as well available through the Ministry of Natural Resources. Fish such as
                bass,
                yellow perch, trout and pike can be found in the waterways of the park. The further an angler is
                willing to
                travel from an access point, the better the fishing. The backcountry lakes do not receive heavy fishing
                pressure.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <blockquote>Algonquin Park has been an important arena for research since the 1930s. Four research
                facilities exist:
                Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research, Wildlife Research Station, Timber Research Station, and the
                visitor
                centre. Over 1800 scientific papers have been published on research done in the park, covering almost
                every
                aspect of the park: wildlife, geology, forestry, history, human impacts, etcetera.

                Also, the remote location and reasonably easy access from the National Research Council's Ottawa base
                of
                operations made the park a natural location for an eastern radio telescope, built in 1959 as the
                Algonquin
                Radio Observatory (ARO). Although radio astronomy is not as active a field of research as it was in the
                1950s
                and 60s, the ARO continues operation today.
