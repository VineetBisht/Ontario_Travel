            <blockquote>Parliament Hill is one of Canada’s most iconic sites and a must-see when visiting Canada’s
                capital. The
                historic, neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings stand tall on a hill overlooking the majestic Ottawa River in
                downtown Ottawa. And although the buildings are home to the country’s federal government (Prime
                Minister
                Justin Trudeau works there), visitors are welcome on-site for free tours and programming all year-long.
                Whether you visit Parliament Hill for a selfie, for a tour, or to experience one of the many free
                events,
                you’ll never run out of things to discover!</blockquote>

            <h3>FREE TOURS</h3>
            <blockquote> Visitors can take free guided tours of two sites that are temporarily housing Parliamentary
                Chambers.
                These
                tours are offered while Parliament’s Centre Block is closed to the public during the building’s
                decade-long
                rehabilitation:

                    <blockquote><strong>House of Commons (West Block on Parliament Hill):</strong> From 2010 to 2018,
                        traditional
                        craftsmanship and cutting-edge technologies were used to create a greener, fully accessible and
                        barrier-free West Block. One of the spectacular new spaces is the glass-roofed structure built
                        into
                        the
                        courtyard. The new state-of-the-art, underground Visitor Welcome Centre (located between West
                        Block
                        and
                        Centre Block) is the tour starting point, and also houses the Parliamentary Boutique.

                        storied
                        past
                        and beautiful architecture: Originally built as Ottawa’s train station in 1912 (the same year
                        as the Fairmont Château Laurier which is located directly across the street), it later became
                        the Government Conference Centre. It was rehabilitated to temporarily house the Senate in part
                        due to its convenient location just one block from Parliament Hill.

            <h3>FREE YEAR-ROUND PROGRAMMING</h3>
            The grounds of Parliament Hill are a welcoming and photogenic place, with large grassy spaces, dozens of
            monuments and the symbolic Centennial Flame. Plus, many special events are held year-round on the large
            front
            lawn, and they’re all free! Here are some highlights you can expect:

            <ul>

                        in London,
                        England –
                        takes place each morning from late June to late August. Watch guards in scarlet uniforms and
                        bearskin hats as they march with precision to the sound of the accompanying military band.

                        projected onto Parliament’s Centre Block and a bilingual (English and French) soundtrack.

                        Many streets
