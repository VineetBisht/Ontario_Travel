            <p>The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada is a traditional Hindu place of
                worship that was built by the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. The BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, which is headed
                by Mahant Swami Maharaj, is a global spiritual organization within the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism.
                The mandir was built in 18 months and consists of 24,000 pieces of hand-carved Italian carrara marble,
                Turkish limestone and Indian pink stone. The mandir is the largest of its kind in Canada and was
                constructed according to guidelines outlined in ancient Hindu scriptures. The grounds spread over 18
                acres and in addition to the mandir, include a haveli and the Heritage Museum. The mandir is open
                daily to visitors and for worship. In July 2017, the temple celebrated its 10-year anniversary.</p>

            <h3>Mandir and Daily Rituals</h3>
            <blockquote>The temple is a type of 'Shikarbaddha' mandir, built according to principles laid out in the
                Shilpa Shastras, Hindu texts prescribing standards of sacred architecture. Within the mandir, murtis
                (sacred images of the deities) have been installed in different shrines. The central shrine holds the
                murti of Swaminarayan, with Gunatitanand Swami to his left, together worshipped as Akshar-Purushottam
                Maharaj. Similarly, different shrines hold murtis of other Hindu deities such as Radha Krishna, Shiva
                Parvati, Sita Ram, Hanuman, Ganapati/Ganesh and the lineage of BAPS gurus who are Swaminarayan's
                spiritual successors.

                Once the divine has been invoked in a murti, it becomes an embodiment of the Divine. Accordingly,
                Swaminarayan sadhus (Hindu monks) offer devotional worship to the deities throughout the day. Before
                dawn, they awaken the deities by singing morning hymns (prabhatiya). The deities are then bathed and
                offered food and garments depending on the time of the day and season. Food that has been offered to
                the deities is considered sanctified. These holy offerings are distributed to the devotees as
                prasadam. Throughout the day, aarti, a ritual where devotees sing the glory of Swaminarayan while a
                lighted wick is circulated before the murtis, is performed five times a day and named mangala aarti,
                shanagar aarti, rajabhoga aarti, sandhya aarti and shayana aarti, respectively. During midday, lunch is
                offered. In the evening, dinner is offered. Finally, the sadhus put the murtis to rest by adorning them
                with night garments.</blockquote>

            <h3>Haveli</h3>
            <blockquote>The mandir's cultural center is referred to as the haveli because of its traditional Indian
                architectural style. The haveli is defined by an intricately carved wooden façade. Inside the haveli
                is a courtyard surrounded by teak and rosewood columns. The columns are characterized by motifs ranging
                from mythological stories, the sun and moon, and animals such as peacocks and elephants. The
                cultural center serves various functions. The assembly hall provides space for weekly congregations.
                Classrooms are used for youth cultural, religious and educational activities, which include music
                lessons, Hindu scripture classes and career development seminars. A full-size gymnasium is used for
                youth sports activities and dining after Sunday evening assemblies. A food shop provides visitors and
                members with an assortment of vegetarian snacks. There is a living quarters for the sadhus who perform
                daily rituals in the mandir.
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Heritage Museum</h4>
            <blockquote>The Heritage Museum houses the Understanding Hindu Dharma Exhibition, which aims to provide
                visitors with a foundation of the key tenets of Hinduism. It walks visitors through a culture and
                faith with origins in antiquity, beginning with an explanation of the origins of Hinduism and
                continuing to an explanation of the role of Hinduism today. It also showcases the role that
                Indo-Canadians have played in developments in the fields of art, architecture, science, democracy,
                education, culture, pluralism and spiritual values.</blockquote>
