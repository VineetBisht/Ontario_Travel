                <p>EdgeWalk is CN Tower’s most thrilling attraction in its history, and the first of its kind in North
                    America. It is the world’s highest full circle hands-free walk
                    on a 5 ft (1.5 m) wide ledge encircling the top of the Tower’s main pod, 356m/1168ft (116 storeys)
                    above the ground. EdgeWalk is a Canadian Signature Experience and an
                    Ontario Signature Experience</p>
                <p>Visitors walk in groups of six, while attached to an overhead safety rail via a trolley and harness
                    system. Trained EdgeWalk guides will encourage participants to push
                    their personal limits, allowing them to lean back over Toronto with nothing but air and
                    breathtaking
                    views of Lake Ontario beneath them.</p>
                <p>Designed with the highest international safety and security standards in mind, EdgeWalk runs for 1.5
                    hours, with the outdoor walk lasting approximately 30 minutes.
                    Tickets starting at $195 CAD (plus tax) and include a keepsake video, printed photos and
                    certificate of
                    achievement. Participants also receive (following your EdgeWalk) a
                    Tower Experience Ticket which includes access to the LookOut, Glass Floor, and SkyPod levels.
                    Tickets
                    are one time use and valid for up to 2 days following your EdgeWalk.</p>

                <p>The EdgeWalk at the CN Tower will operate seasonally in all weather except for electrical storms,
                    high
                    winds or other extreme weather conditions. Varying weather
                    conditions will make the EdgeWalk experience more unique. Please dress appropriately for the
                    weather
                    conditions.</p>
